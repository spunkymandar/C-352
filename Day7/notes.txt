Exception handling
-------------------
1. What is exception
	Unwanted execution that generates during during runtime
	Something because of which your program abruptly terminates
			Object  
			
			Throwable 
	
	Error 					Exception
							  IOException				RunTimeException
							  FileNotFoundExcpetion		  ArithmeticException
							  							  NullPointerException
							  							  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExcpetion
	
	
	
	
2. Types of Exceptions
	Checked Exception : checked at compilation, you are forced to handle it.
	Unchecked Excpetion
3. What do you mean to handle it
	Handling the exception is NOT ALWAYS RECTIFYING it 
	a.Program gracefully shuts down with proper message 
	b.The segments which are not connected with the exception whould executed as expected 

4. How to handle it
	a. find out the part of the code which is under threat of exception 
	b. put that code under the try block 
	c. add the catch block which will have the arugument matching with the exception that you are expecting
	try(){
	}catch(){}

	try with catch
	try with finally
	try with catch and finally 
	
try,catch,finally, throws, throw
